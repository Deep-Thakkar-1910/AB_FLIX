# Best Practices in API Development

This codebase demonstrates several best practices in API development, particularly in structuring and securing a Node.js and Express application. Below are 10 notable best practices illustrated in the provided code snippets:

1. **Modular Route Handling:**

   - The application's routing is organized into separate modules (`userRoutes`, `movieRoutes`, `tvShowRoutes`, etc.), making the codebase more manageable and scalable.

2. **Controller Separation:**

   - Business logic is separated from routing logic by using controllers (`userController`, `movieController`, etc.), which helps in maintaining a clean code structure and facilitates easier unit testing.

3. **Environment Variable Usage:**

   - Sensitive information and configuration settings (like the database URL and JWT secret) are stored in environment variables, enhancing security and flexibility across different deployment environments.

4. **Middleware for Authentication:**

   - The `authenticateJWT` middleware is used to protect routes that require user authentication, ensuring that only authorized requests access sensitive endpoints.

5. **Error Handling:**

   - Error handling is consistently implemented across controllers, with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages returned to the client, improving the API's robustness and usability.

6. **JWT for Secure Authentication:**

   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure user authentication, a widely adopted standard that enables stateless authentication.

7. **Password Hashing:**

   - User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database, significantly enhancing the security of user credentials.

8. **Pagination in List Endpoints:**

   - Endpoints that return lists of resources (like movies and TV shows) implement pagination, reducing server load and improving response times for large datasets.

9. **Regular Expressions for Search Functionality:**

   - The search functionality in the movie and TV show routes uses regular expressions, allowing for flexible and powerful search capabilities.

10. **Use of Projection in Database Queries:**
    - MongoDB's projection feature is used in database queries to limit the fields returned in the response, optimizing query performance and minimizing network bandwidth usage.

These practices contribute to a secure, maintainable, and efficient API application, showcasing effective patterns for Node.js and Express development.
